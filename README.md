Polygom√© has four modes. Play mode is default. Play mode will begin a pattern on the button you press. A new pattern can be entered if you are in record mode. Up to eight steps can be entered directly on the button surface. Velocity mode enables you to enter a velocity value for each step. The steps are represented as rising bars . Duration/step mode is a bit more complex. The bottom row represents enable/disable states for each step. The seven buttons above each enable/disable toggle operate like the rising velocity bars. The lowest amount = 1 step which is equal to 1 16th note. Higher bars = longer notes for the corresponding step.
